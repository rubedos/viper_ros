Can I upgrade VIPER using apt upgrade command?
---------------------------------------------------------------

This is **not recommended** and by doing so you may lose the warranty.

Contact support if you have not found a solution to your problem in this documentation.



How do I check VIPER logs?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Connect to your VIPER via ssh:

.. code-block:: bash

    ssh <VIPER_IP>

Depending on the app/issue run one of the following.

App service status:

.. code-block:: bash

    systemctl status cvm-webconfig
    systemctl status cvm-stereo
    systemctl status cvm-follow-me
    systemctl status cvm-follow-aruco
    systemctl status cvm-obstactle-detector

App logs:

.. code-block:: bash

    journalctl -u cvm-webconfig
    journalctl -u cvm-stereo
    journalctl -u cvm-follow-me
    journalctl -u cvm-follow-aruco
    journalctl -u cvm-obstactle-detector


How do I fix the "unable to communicate with master!" error?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

Is your VIPER running and active? If no, please turn it on.

Is your ``ROS_MASTER_URI`` set correctly? If no, please set the ``ROS_MASTER_URI`` to the location of your VIPER.

Can you contact the address specified in the ``ROS_MASTER_URI``?

.. code-block:: bash

   echo $ROS_MASTER_URI
   http://<VIPER_IP>:11311
   ping <VIPER_IP>
   ping: unknown host <VIPER_IP>

If you get the "unknown host" error, please check your network settings or change the ``ROS_MASTER_URI`` to a resolvable address.

How do I find VIPER IP address?
---------------------------------------------------------------
Please refer to  `VIPER Discovery`_.

How do I synchronize VIPER's clock to the clock of a robot?
---------------------------------------------------------------

On your robot's PC (Ubuntu OS) install and enable Chrony:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install chrony
    sudo systemctl start chrony
    sudo systemctl enable chrony

Set up Chrony NTP server on the robot's PC

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo vim /etc/chrony/chrony.conf

and paste this:

.. code-block:: bash

    driftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift
    local stratum 10
    manual
    allow 10.42.0.0/24

.. note:: Change network IP (**10.42.0.0** in this example) to the IP of your network

Then reboot your robot's PC or restart the Chrony service

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo systemctl restart chrony


.. note:: The configuration will run automatically when you power on the PC next time. This is required only once.

On the VIPER you just have to set `ROS MASTER`_ of the configured robot PC. The two computers should synchronize after reboot.
Also, there is a possibility to force synchronization by pressing *Force sync* in **System time** on the VIPER's web page.

How do I fix md5sum error while running a demo application?
---------------------------------------------------------------

There is an issue with some ROS package version, therefore we need to get the newest version.

Connect to your VIPER via ssh:

.. code-block:: bash

    ssh <VIPER_IP>

and run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo cp /opt/rubedo/cvm/cvm-debs-update.bash  /home/ubuntu/cvm-debs-update_cp.bash 
    sudo /home/ubuntu/cvm-debs-update_cp.bash 


How do fix 'Could not load library (Poco exception = libopencv_calib3d3.so.3.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory'?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Connect to your VIPER via ssh:

.. code-block:: bash

    ssh <VIPER_IP>

and run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-opencv3=3.3.1-0xenial
