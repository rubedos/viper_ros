VIPER Core
===============================

VIPER Core is the base functionality that comes with each instance. `ROS API`_ is used to communicate with the device.

VIPER Core consists of the following features.

.. note:: All topics are provided without a namespace. When you are using your VIPER, please take its namespace into account.

RGB Image Streaming
===============================
VIPER has a set of two cameras. Images come in several formats:

- Uncalibrated separate left and right images;
- Uncalibrated combined left and right images;
- Calibrated separate left and right images;
- Calibrated combined left and right images.

Using ROS Tools
------------------

`rviz`_ and `rqt`_ can be used to view images.

.. code-block:: bash

    rosrun image_view image_view image:=/image_raw

Code Sample
------------------

The following sample will allow you to stream images from your VIPER and display
them using `OpenCV`_ library.

First you need to create a catkin workspace.

.. code-block:: bash

    source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
    mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
    cd ~/catkin_ws
    catkin init

Then create a simple package using the following files.

:download:`image_streaming/main.cpp <samples/image_streaming/main.cpp>`

.. literalinclude:: samples/image_streaming/main.cpp
    :language: cpp

:download:`image_streaming/CMakeLists.txt <samples/image_streaming/CMakeLists.txt>`

.. literalinclude:: samples/image_streaming/CMakeLists.txt
   :language: cmake

:download:`image_streaming/package.xml <samples/image_streaming/package.xml>`

.. literalinclude:: samples/image_streaming/package.xml
   :language: xml

Build and run the sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/catkin_ws
    catkin build image_streaming
    source devel/setup.bash
    export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<VIPER_IP>:11311
    rosrun image_streaming image_streaming

You should see ``image_raw`` topic being published to the ``Image view`` window.
Please refer to `ROS API`_ to see the full list of topics.

Disparity Map Streaming
===============================

`Disparity image`_ is an image that contains a shift value for each pixel in the left `rectified image`_
with respect to the right `rectified image`_ of the same scene, while both images have been
taken at the same time.

Using ROS Tools
------------------

`image_view`_ package can be used to view disparity images.

.. code-block:: bash

    rosrun image_view disparity_view image:=/disparity

Code Sample
------------------

The following sample will allow you to stream disparity map from your VIPER.
It converts disparity image which is float type to grayscale image using `OpenCV`_ library.

First you need to create a catkin workspace.

.. code-block:: bash

    source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
    mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
    cd ~/catkin_ws
    catkin init

Then create a simple package using the following files.

:download:`disparity_streaming/main.cpp <samples/disparity_streaming/main.cpp>`

.. literalinclude:: samples/disparity_streaming/main.cpp
    :language: cpp

:download:`disparity_streaming/CMakeLists.txt <samples/disparity_streaming/CMakeLists.txt>`

.. literalinclude:: samples/disparity_streaming/CMakeLists.txt
   :language: cmake

:download:`disparity_streaming/package.xml <samples/disparity_streaming/package.xml>`

.. literalinclude:: samples/disparity_streaming/package.xml
   :language: xml

Build and run the sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/catkin_ws
    catkin build disparity_streaming
    source devel/setup.bash
    export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<VIPER_IP>:11311
    rosrun disparity_streaming disparity_streaming

You should see ``disparity`` topic being published to the ``Disparity view`` window.


Point Cloud Streaming
===============================

`Point cloud`_ is a 3D data structure that contains x, y, z coordinates (in meters) for each pixel in
left rectified image, and describes a 3D scene.

Using ROS Tools
------------------

`rviz`_ can be used to view point clouds.

  - run rviz [rosrun rviz rviz];

  - Add display type in rviz [Add->PointCloud2];

  - Browse for the ``points2`` topic;

  - Make sure correct link is selected, e.g. ``cvm_base_link``.

Code Sample
------------------

The following sample will allow you to stream point clouds from your VIPER.
It uses `PCL`_ library to visualize point clouds received from VIPER.

First you need to create a catkin workspace.

.. code-block:: bash

    source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
    mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
    cd ~/catkin_ws
    catkin init

Then create a simple package using the following files.

:download:`pointcloud_streaming/main.cpp <samples/pointcloud_streaming/main.cpp>`

.. literalinclude:: samples/pointcloud_streaming/main.cpp
    :language: cpp

:download:`pointcloud_streaming/CMakeLists.txt <samples/pointcloud_streaming/CMakeLists.txt>`

.. literalinclude:: samples/pointcloud_streaming/CMakeLists.txt
   :language: cmake

:download:`pointcloud_streaming/package.xml <samples/pointcloud_streaming/package.xml>`

.. literalinclude:: samples/pointcloud_streaming/package.xml
   :language: xml

Build and run the sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/catkin_ws
    catkin build pointcloud_streaming
    source devel/setup.bash
    export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<VIPER_IP>:11311
    rosrun pointcloud_streaming pointcloud_streaming

You should see ``points2`` topic being published to the ``PointCloud view`` window.
Please refer to `PCL documentation`_ in order to get familiar with point cloud processing.
