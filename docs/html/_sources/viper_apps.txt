VIPER Apps
===============================

VIPER has multiple applications available that deal with specific tasks and have to be ordered separately.

FollowMe
===================

FollowMe is a VIPER application that tracks bounding box of the given human between frames and provides distance to the target.

Here we provide a simple GUI program (using `QT`_) that visualizes all detected humans in the left camera image. When one particular bounding box is
selected by clicking on it, it is sent to the FollowMe App as a target and from that moment - being tracked. Distance to the target is
also displayed. It can be used to tell the robot where the target is.

Code Sample
------------------

First you need to create a catkin workspace.

.. code-block:: bash

    source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
    mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
    cd ~/catkin_ws
    catkin init

Then create a simple package using the following files.

:download:`cvm_follow_me_sample/include/FollowMeWindow.h <samples/cvm_follow_me_sample/include/FollowMeWindow.h>`

.. literalinclude:: samples/cvm_follow_me_sample/include/FollowMeWindow.h
    :language: cpp

:download:`cvm_follow_me_sample/src/FollowMeWindow.cpp <samples/cvm_follow_me_sample/src/FollowMeWindow.cpp>`

.. literalinclude:: samples/cvm_follow_me_sample/src/FollowMeWindow.cpp
    :language: cpp

:download:`cvm_follow_me_sample/src/main.cpp <samples/cvm_follow_me_sample/src/main.cpp>`

.. literalinclude:: samples/cvm_follow_me_sample/src/main.cpp
    :language: cpp

:download:`cvm_follow_me_sample/package.xml <samples/cvm_follow_me_sample/package.xml_>`

.. literalinclude:: samples/cvm_follow_me_sample/package.xml_
    :language: xml

:download:`cvm_follow_me_sample/CMakeLists.txt <samples/cvm_follow_me_sample/CMakeLists.txt>`

.. literalinclude:: samples/cvm_follow_me_sample/CMakeLists.txt
    :language: cmake

:download:`cvm_follow_me_sample/ui/FollowMeWindow.ui <samples/cvm_follow_me_sample/ui/FollowMeWindow.ui>`

Build and run the sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/catkin_ws
    catkin build cvm_follow_me_sample
    source devel/setup.bash
    export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<VIPER_IP>:11311
    export ROS_IP=<HOST_IP>
    rosrun cvm_follow_me_sample cvm_follow_me_sample

Enable the FollowMe app and click on the person you want to track. The person who is being tracked
will be marked with a red bounding box.

.. note:: Make sure the ``ROS_IP`` you set is the IP of the host machine that is connected to your VIPER, otherwise you will not be able to enable the FollowMe App while using the sample above. For more information about networking please refer to `ROS Network Setup`_.

Obstacle Detector
===================

Obstacle Detector is a VIPER application that imitates laser scan by processing point cloud produced by the camera.
Output can be used as an input for a robot path planner.
If laser scan is not visible you might need to play with `Obstacle Detector configuration`_, by providing relevant target frame and
transform.

Using ROS Tools
------------------

`rviz`_ and can be used to view output of the Object Detector App.

  - run rviz [rosrun rviz rviz];

  - Add display type in rviz [Add->LaserScan];

  - Browse for the ``laser_scan`` topic;

  - Make sure correct link is selected, e.g. ``cvm_base_link``.
